# Write your content in markdown for quick and easy editing

You can write your content in markdown, making it easier, quicker, and more accessible to author and update your site. Similarly to adding components, just add markdown content to your html by using the same `%%` syntax, but adding the `markdown` or `md` command before the source of the text: `%% md my_markdown.md`
